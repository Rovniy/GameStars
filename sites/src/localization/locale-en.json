  "REVIEW_3": "I accidentally heard about the tournament from my friends. Gave it a try, ended up 17th out of 300 people. 10$ is a nice win, considering it was my first tournament and I am not some kind of a famous pro gamer",
  "REVIEW_4": "I loved the unusual way of matchmaking and the helpfulness and quickness of the support team during the tournament.",
  "REVIEW_5": "I liked the idea of such tournament, where you can win money playing for yourself.",

The best features are the tournaments unusual rules and the way how teams are formed. Wish you guys further success!",
  "REVIEW_11": "The tournament was remarkable due to the unusual way of matchmaking and responsiveness and speed of the support team. Also I liked that gamers of any rating could win real cash prizes because there is no tournament bracket. You can play at (almost) any time you want. Overall I liked the tournament and are waiting for the next ones.",
  "REVIEW_12": "I liked the GameStars tournament because there is no tournament bracket. To participate in a match you didn’t have to wait for appearance and approval of the bracket. This was a big advantage. Secondly, I liked the betting system. And definitely I should mention the great prize pool. Thank you!",
  "REVIEW_13": "I liked the tournament. I was overcome with emotions. There were ups and downs, stress and of course joy of victory, Despite the fact that I didn’t make it to the first place I see my top-10 position as an achievement. I will definitely take part in the upcoming tournaments!",
  "REVIEW_14": "The tournament was unique due to the absolutely new system, easy-going support team, great program and of course BETS, bets and bets again. P.S. and I also liked great web site design!!",
