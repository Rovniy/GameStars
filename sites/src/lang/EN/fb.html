<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>GameStars.gg - LoL tournaments for all! You can win money there!</strong><br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I've discovered something amazing today! eSports are not only for pro-gamers! It seems that almost everyone can win money in LoL now.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How can it be?
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I found that site recently - GameStars.gg. Tournaments? But how? Where? Will Faker be there too?
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But no. You won't be matched against Demon King himself :) Those tournaments are more like series of ranked LoL matches. Ranked, not normal. You'll be matched only with people of your skill level. No wild Diamonds against humble Silvers, if you know what I mean.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So - you play and every match brings you more tournament points. You can play any number of matches anytime you like. Up to 30% of all players win money in each tournament.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The coolest thing â€“ you can bet on your own victory! You win, your bet is doubled and you feel like a boss :)
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you don't like to play long - there are Cash Games. 1 ranked LoL match with bets. You can easily win real cash after 30-45 minutes. Not bad.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Long story short - try it. You want to play LoL anyway, right? Than why don't win some money doing it? :)
