    <li><strong> Tournament Participation Rules</strong></li>
    <li>In order to participate in any GameStars tournament, the user needs to:
        <ul>
            <li>Log into their personal account at GameStars</li>
            <li>Tie their game account to an account at the GameStars website. The users must meet the server and game account level requirements stipulated in the tournament rules.</li>
            <li>Users need to go to the tournament page, click "Participate" and confirm that they want to take part in the tournament.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>After a user confirms that he/she wants to take part in a tournament, the tournament participation cost will be withdrawn from the user's account, and a starting stack will appear in the tournament account that is equal to the number of chips shown on the tournament page. Users can check stack sizes in their personal accounts throughout the tournament either on the active tournaments page or on the tournament table on the tournament page.</li>
    <li>Some tournaments allow a rebuy option, which means that users can can buy additional chips after a tournament has started. The rebuy conditions, price and procedure are given on the tournament page.</li>
    <li>Any player that has completed at least five tournament matches during a tournament can claim a prize place in the tournament.</li>
    <li>All tournament members should have a good command of English so that they can communicate freely with their allies.</li>
    <li><strong> Special Conditions for Tournament Matches </strong></li>
    <li>Users shall be placed in a queue to be selected for a match after meeting the following conditions:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>client has the latest version of the game on his/her computer,</li>
    <li>user has registered for a tournament,</li>
    <li>user has placed a bet and clicked "Play" within the active hours of a tournament.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
    <li>The algorithm used to form teams to take part in a match will select allies and rivals from the users that are currently in the queue at the GameStars platform.</li>
    <li>Tournaments are open only for individual players, and allies and rivals for each match are randomly selected based on the ratings of tournament participants.</li>
    <li>The tournament ratings are determined on the GameStars platform and may differ from the game ratings. On the GameStars platform, the rating for a user is calculated based on data from all game servers within a single game discipline. Ratings depend both on ratings from each individual game, as well as on the outcome of matches played on the GameStars platform.</li>
    <li>To participate in tournament matches, users must place a bet with chips that is between the minimum and maximum bet limits.</li>
    <li>The bet structure for a tournament is shown on the tournament page. As a rule, each tournament is divided into several levels that have different minimum and maximum allowed bets. The maximum bet is usually five times higher than the minimum one.</li>
    <li>Each user independently selects a bet to participate in the tournament, but bets must be within the minimum and maximum range set for a particular tournament level.</li>
    <li>After all players have been selected for a particular match, the aggregate bet shall be calculated for each team on both sides.</li>
    <li>If a player is on the team with a lower aggregate bet, his full bet will accepted.</li>
    <li>If a player is on the team with a higher aggregate bet, then:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>the equation below is used to calculate the difference between the bets of the two teams: aggregate amount_1 - aggregate amount_2 = aggregate amount_difference</li>
    <li>the equation below is used to calculate a player's share in the aggregate team bet: bet/aggregate amount_1 = share</li>
    <li>a player is paid back a part of the difference in bets in proportion to his/her share according to the equation: aggregate amount_difference * share = returned amount</li>
    <li>a player's final bet that is accepted for a match is: final bet = bet - returned amount</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
    <li>If a player does not have a sufficient tournament stack (number of chips) to place a minimum tournament bet, that player will have to leave the tournament.</li>
    <li><strong> Prize Pool and Payments Procedure</strong></li>
    <li>The winners of the tournament will be determined based on who has the highest tournament stack (number of chips) at the end of the tournament.</li>
    <li>The prize pool will be distributed among those players that have accumulated the largest stacks within the tournament.</li>
    <li>The number of prize places is shown on the tournament page. This number may be either fixed or variable. For instance, for the No Limits Tournament, the prize pool grows based on the number of participants, and the number of prize places is set as a percentage of the overall number of tournament players. The size of the price pool and distribution methods are shown on the page of each tournament.</li>
    <li>The tournament results will be published on the business day following the last day of the tournament.</li>
    <li>The gains will be transferred to the winners by crediting their player accounts on the GameStars platform.</li>
    <li>In order to withdraw funds from the GameStars platform, a user should place a withdrawal order on his personal account, indicating the withdrawal method.</li>
    <li><strong> Additional Information</strong></li>
    <li>Users automatically accept these rules when registering for a tournament.</li>
    <li>The website administration may, at any time, make any changes and additions to these rules without any additional notice being sent out to users.</li>

    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Tournament Matches</span></li>
    <li>After the GameStars system selects 10 people to take part in the match, a tournament member will receive a notice that the match teams have been formed. Each of the ten match members must accept the match within 1 minute by clicking the "Ready" button in order to enter the match lobby.</li>
    <li>If any player does not click "Ready" in time or clicks "Cancel", the formed teams will be disbanded. In this case, members will have to manually queue for a match on the tournament page.</li>
    <li>When all members have clicked "Ready", the match lobby will be launched.</li>
    <li>Tournament members confirm they are ready to play a match by clicking "Ready" in the notification window, at the GameStars website. At this point, the chips used to play the tournament match will be frozen.</li>

    <li>No rematch will be due, and no incurred losses will be reimbursed or returned, whenever any failures occur due to a lost connection or failures of the client, platform, network or PC, or unsportsmanlike behavior on the part of allies or opponents.</li>
    <li>After the match lobby has been launched at the GameStars website, the members have a 2-minute period during which they can discuss the game strategy in the team chat room and confirm that they are ready to play. When the 2-minute period has ended or all members click "Ready", whichever happens first, the game will be launched in the LoL client.</li>
    <li>If either team is missing any of its members in the GameStars match lobby, then:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>When any player is offline, an additional 3-minute period will be assigned so the missing player can restore a connection. If, after 3 minutes, the player has not reconnected, the bet that he made will be equally distributed among all match members and the match will be disbanded.</li>
    <li>If a player reconnects within 3 minutes, the match will be launched as originally created.</li>

</ol>
<ul>
    <li>In the GameStars match lobby, a member will be assigned to either a team to the left or the right. In the LoL match lobby, irrespective of which team a player was originally assigned, he should join the team located at the same side as the one in the GameStars match lobby.</li>
    <li>In the GameStars match lobby, users will be able to see the nicknames of their teammates as they are shown in the LoL match lobby. Members should check the nicknames of their teammates in order to make sure they match both in the LoL lobby and the GameStars lobby.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10">
    <li>The tournament member who enters the LoL match lobby first will be in charge of clicking "Start Game" on time. He can click that button only after all match members have entered the lobby and it has been confirmed that the teams match the divisions at the GameStars website.</li>
    <li>During the match, pause may be activated when any player goes offline. Any one pause may not take more than 5 minutes. Any deliberate pausing will be penalized and a player in breach will be disqualified from GameStars tournaments for an indefinite period.</li>
    <li>During a match, players are prohibited from intentionally disconnecting from the Internet.</li>
    <li>Players must not close the GameStars website until the match results have been shown.</li>
    <li>As soon as the match ends, the preliminary results will be shown in the match lobby. More detailed data will be transmitted from Riot Games, the game producer, depending on how fast the data is processed. As a rule, this takes no more than 2-3 minutes.
