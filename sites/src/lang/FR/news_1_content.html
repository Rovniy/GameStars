    <strong>Hello!</strong>

    <p>
        Today we’d like to tell you about our League of Legends test tournament dedicated to the 2016 New Year celebration!
    </p>

    <p>
        This tournament, first ever in the history of our platform, was unique in many regards. The key to victory was not in high values of skill or knowledge, but in thoughtful distribution of tournament chips we have handed to the participants. Responsible approach to every match and the ability to communicate with random teammates were crucial to the outcome as well!
    </p>

    <p>
        This new tournament type we are offering is different from the rest out there:

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Every match the participant joins a new team. The team consists of allies whose playing skill matches one another;

        </li>
        <li>
            Every match the participant makes a bet with his chips. The winner of the tournament is decided by the amount of chips accumulated, not by the number of victories;

        </li>
        <li>
            The number of matches played and their outcome are not as important. What matters most is the bets made by the participant and the amount of chips earned from each game;

        </li>

        <li>
            The participants can play as many matches during the tournament as they want to.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        These uncommon rules have attracted over 500 participants, while employing the automated matchmaking service we have developed allowed us to run 340 games in 38 hours. Meanwhile, the NA or EU LCS from Riot Games have only run 180 matches and playoff games during the entire 5th season!
    </p>

    <p>
        The tournament’s impressive results:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            28 000 rubles (1st place) were earned by the Gold league player!

        </li>
        <li>
            21 000 rubles (2nd place) were earned by the Silver league player!

        </li>
        <li>
            48 000 rubles were earned by the players coming too late for the tournament start, thanks to the opportunity of late registration!
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong> 70% of tournament participants</strong> were above the Gold league in the LoL rating!

        </li>

        <li>
            <strong> 99% of participants</strong> wish to participate in our future tournaments!
        </li>


        <li>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>

        Thanks to the activity of the tournament participants we have successfully completed the test launch, receiving a plenty of comments and suggestions on improving the site and the StarClient! This feedback from the players helped us to choose our priorities and plans for the future:

    </p>


    <ol>
        <li>
            Building up the amount of participants to ensure quality team allocation;

        </li>

        <li>
            Fully automated system to track rules violations and deal punishments;

        </li>

        <li>
            Socialization of the site (communications, personal cabinet, player statistics, achievements etc);

        </li>

        <li>
            Large European tournament with the LAN finale in Europe for those who have qualified from the online tournament with chips;

        </li>

        <li>

        <p>Your tournament place depends on you alone. Sure, there is a random element, but it can be compensated by increasing the game time or the bet raising period</p>

        <p>I am pleasantly surprised that I could win something after playing only a couple of matches, not too much, but still. Told all my friends</p>
